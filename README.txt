Hi miss,

When you run the website as i use ajax you need to use the python http.server console command,

to do this you need to navigate to the main directory(".../Collector/main") in comand prompt and then run this line:
1. python -m http.server 
2. python3 -m http.server
3. py -m http.server

if one dosent work try another!

If some images are missing please run the python script located @ "../Collector/scripts/parser_tsv.py"

Thanks for taking the time to mark my assingment, I am looking foward to seeing my mark
